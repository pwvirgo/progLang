(* 3. Write a function number_in_months that takes a list of dates and
a list of months (i.e., an int list) and returns the number of dates
in the list of dates that are in any of the months in the list of
months.  Assume the list of months has no number repeated. Hint: Use
your answer to the previous problem *)

month (i.e., an int) and returns a list holding the dates from the
argument list of dates that are in the month. The returned list should
contain dates in the order they were originally given. *)

a list of months (i.e., an int list) and returns a list holding the
dates from the argument list of dates that are in any of the months in
the list of months. Assume the list of months has no number
repeated. Hint: Use your answer to the previous problem and SMLâ€™s
list-append operator (@). *)

(* 6. Write a function get_nth that takes a list of strings and an int
n and returns the n th element of the list where the head of the list
is 1st. Do not worry about the case where the list has too few
elements: your function may apply hd or tl to the empty list in this
case, which is okay*)

(* 7. Write a function date_to_string that takes a date and returns a
string of the form January 20, 2013 (for example). Use the operator ^
for concatenating strings and the library function Int.toString for
converting an int to a string. For producing the month part, do not
use a bunch of conditionals.  Instead, use a list holding 12 strings
and your answer to the previous problem. For consistency, put a comma
following the day and use capitalized English month names: January,
February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October,
November, December. *)

(* 8. Write a function number_before_reaching_sum that takes an int
called sum, which you can assume is positive, and an int list, which
you can assume contains all positive numbers, and returns an int.  You
should return an int n such that the first n elements of the list add
to less than sum, but the first n + 1 elements of the list add to sum
or more. Assume the entire list sums to more than the passed in value;
it is okay for an exception to occur if this is not the case. *)

(* 9. Write a function what_month that takes a day of year (i.e., an
int between 1 and 365) and returns what month that day is in (1 for
January, 2 for February, etc.). Use a list holding 12 integers and
your answer to the previous problem. *)

(* 10. Write a function month_range that takes two days of the year
day1 and day2 and returns an int list [m1,m2,...,mn] where m1 is the
month of day1, m2 is the month of day1+1, ..., and mn is the month of
day day2. Note the result will have length day2 - day1 + 1 or length 0
if day1>day2. *)

evaluates to an (int*int*int) option. It evaluates to NONE if the list
has no dates and SOME d if the date d is the oldest date in the
list. *)
